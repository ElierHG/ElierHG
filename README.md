# Hi there 👋
I'm Elier, a self-taught developer continuously expanding my knowledge in Computer Science and software development. In my day-to-day role, I design and maintain business applications using the Microsoft Power Platform.


###About Me

🌱 Learning: Constantly improving my skills in backend and frontend technologies.

🌐 Open-Source Aspirations: While I'm new to open source, I'm eager to contribute and make a meaningful impact. I’m particularly interested in projects like OpenBlocks and PocketBlocks.

🛠 Project Goals: I hope to one day build my own app platform, using Svelte for the frontend and Go for the backend.
